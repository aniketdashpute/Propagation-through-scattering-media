1. The python code which gives scattered field is in:
scattering_field_from_sphere_1_0.py

2. The data is taken from here and exported in matlab.
This data is contained in the .mat file:
Python_data_02_03_19.mat

3. In matlab, run this file:
main_holopy_scattering

4. The figures are labelled. 
E0 is for n=0
E1 is for n=1
E is the combined field
Ef is focused beam (which as of now returns without focus)
